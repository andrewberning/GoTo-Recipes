# Project Ideas

Project Idea #1:
  Create a Recipe Food site using "TheMealDB" API. You will register an account and search for food recipes based upon ingredient(s)/title(s) of recipes. I want to implement a way to save/delete recipe(s) to your account so they can be referenced/deleted at a later time. I would also like to implement a way to comment on the recipe(s) so users can share  what they like/dislike about the recipe(s). 

Project Idean #2:
  Cocktail site using "cocktailDB" API. You will register an account and search for cocktail recipes based upon ingredient(s)/title(s) of recipes. I want to implement a way to save/delete recipes to your account to reference later. I would like to also create a way to comment on the recipe(s) so users can share their experiences/ideas about the recipe(s).

Project Idea  #3:
  Build and eCommerce site using a food API. You will register an account and search for items from a store. I want to have a cart to save items you would like to buy from the store and save them to a "previously bought" list.
