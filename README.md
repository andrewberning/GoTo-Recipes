# Capstone Project One

[GoToRecipes](https://goto-recipes.onrender.com) is LIVE!!!

## Project Description
My first Capstone Project is called "GoTo Recipes". It is a Recipe Food website using the [Spoonacular API](https://spoonacular.com/food-api) to get data about specific recipes. Users can register or login to their account and search for food recipes based on titles of recipes in the API. Users alos have an extra option to get a set of random recipes. Users can choose to save recipes to their favorites list and delete them as well.

## User Types
Users who visit this site would be anyone looking to find recipes by title and save them for future reference.

## User Flow
The user flows for this website will be: <ol><li>A login page for existing users to login</li><li>A register page for new users to signup</li><li>A home page where users can search for recipes by recipe title:<ul><li>After clicking the search button with a query, the first 10 recipes load</li><li>If the user wants to view more recipes from their search, they can click the view more button at the end of the list to do so</li><li>Users can also click the Random Recipes button to get 10 random recipes from the API</li></ul></li><li>A single recipe page: <ul><li>Show the title, image, and a short description of the recipe</li><li>Also, buttons to go to the full recipe website, return to search, and go to favorites</li></ul></li><li>A favorites page that shows all of the users favorite recipes: <ul><li>User can click to see single recipe page</li><li>Delete recipe from list</li></ul></li><li>Logout</li></ol> 

## API Notes
The [Spoonacular API](https://spoonacular.com/food-api) is very easy to use for this website. You have to use an API key to make calls to their API. You must create an account with Spoonacular to obtain one. Signup was easy and their documentation is great. This API allows you to do many things. The possibilites seem endless. Check them out!

## Tech Stack
The tech stack I used for this website consisted of Python/Flask, Jinja, WTForms, PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy, Javascript, HTML, CSS.

## Extra Notes
If the website takes a while to run, be patient for it is on the free tier of Render. <br/> For the Spoonacular service, I am also using the free tier. If there is an error code 402, this means no more calls to the API can be made until the quota resets (Quota resets daily at midnight UTC, check back tomorrow).
